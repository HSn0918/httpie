# HTTPie-like CLI Tool in Rust

A naive HTTPie implementation with Rust, can you imagine how easy it is?

## Features

- Send GET and POST requests
- Pretty print JSON responses with syntax highlighting
- Custom HTTP headers
- Command-line interface with subcommands

## Installation

To build and run this project, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HSn0918/httpie.git
    cd httpie
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. Run the executable:

    ```sh
    ./target/release/httpie
    ```

## Usage

This tool supports `get` and `post` subcommands for sending HTTP GET and POST requests respectively.

### GET Request

Send a GET request to the specified URL.

```sh
./httpie get <URL>
```

Example:

```sh
./httpie get http://example.com
```

### POST Request

Send a POST request to the specified URL with key-value pairs as the request body.

```sh
./httpie post <URL> <key=value>...
```

Example:

```sh
./httpie post https://httpbin.org/post greeting=hola name=Tyr
```

## Examples

### GET Request

```sh
./httpie get https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
```

Expected output:

```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
    "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit...
}
```

### POST Request

```sh
./httpie post https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts title=foo body=bar userId=1
```

Expected output:

```json
{
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 101
}
```

## Development
